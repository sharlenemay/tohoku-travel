Sustainability is not just our priority; it's our identity
as a travel organization. Tohoku Travel is dedicated to
promoting sustainable travel that protects the environment,
honors local culture, and supports small businesses. Since
the tragedy of the 2011 East Japan Earthquake, Tohoku Travel
has been working closely with local organizations to revive the natural
beauty of the region and build up its local communities. 
One way Tohoku Travel does so is by curating our recommendations
with green hotels and businesses that are trusted and loved by 
travelers around the world. Another way is through our several volunteer
projects. Check them out below!





Tohoku Travel started with a vision in 2021 for the northeastern region
of Japan. With breathtaking views and opportunities for immersive cultural experiences, 
Tohoku Travel wanted to share this special part of Japan with nature-lovers 
and adventure-seekers around the world. Tohoku Travel is dedicated to promoting the natural beauty and culture of
Japan's northeastern region through sustainable tourism and helping 
create meaningful experiences for travelers of all ages.
